.SH "TABLE RELATIONSHIPS"
.PP
The following diagram shows the relationship among tables in the
database.  Each node represents a table.  Tables that are part of the
``root set'' are shown with double borders.  Each edge leads from the
table that contains it and points to the table that its value
represents.  Edges are labeled with their column names, followed by a
constraint on the number of allowed values: \fB?\fR for zero or one,
\fB*\fR for zero or more, \fB+\fR for one or more.  Thick lines
represent strong references; thin lines represent weak references.

The physical switch or switches managed by the VTEP\fR.

When a physical switch integrates support for this VTEP schema, which
is expected to be the most common case, this column should point to one
\fBPhysical_Switch\fR record that represents the switch
itself\fR.  In another possible implementation, a server or a VM presents
a VTEP schema front-end interface to one or more physical switches,
presumably communicating with those physical switches over a
proprietary protocol\fR.  In that case, this column would point to one
\fBPhysical_Switch\fR for each physical switch, and the set
might change over time as the front-end server comes to represent a

.ST "Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD):"
BFD, defined in RFC 5880, allows point to point detection of
connectivity failures by occasional transmission of BFD control
messages\fR. VTEPs are expected to implement BFD\fR.
.PP
BFD operates by regularly transmitting BFD control messages at a
rate negotiated independently in each direction\fR.  Each endpoint
specifies the rate at which it expects to receive control messages,
and the rate at which it\(cqs willing to transmit them\fR.  An endpoint
which fails to receive BFD control messages for a period of three
times the expected reception rate will signal a connectivity
fault\fR.  In the case of a unidirectional connectivity issue, the
system not receiving BFD control messages will signal the problem
to its peer in the messages it transmits\fR.
.PP
A hardware VTEP is expected to use BFD to determine reachability of
devices at the end of the tunnels with which it exchanges data\fR. This
can enable the VTEP to choose a functioning service node among a set of
service nodes providing high availability\fR. It also enables the NVC to
report the health status of tunnels\fR.
.PP
In most cases the BFD peer of a hardware VTEP will be an Open vSwitch
instance\fR. The Open vSwitch implementation of BFD aims to comply
faithfully with the requirements put forth in RFC 5880\fR.  Open vSwitch
does not implement the optional Authentication or ``Echo Mode\(cq\(cq

.IP "\fBbfd_params : min_tx\fR: optional string, containing an integer, at least 1"
The shortest interval, in milliseconds, at which this BFD session is

transmitted at a slower rate if the remote endpoint is not willing to
receive as quickly as specified\fR.  Defaults to \fB100\fR\fR.
.IP "\fBbfd_params : decay_min_rx\fR: optional string, containing an integer"
An alternate receive interval, in milliseconds, that must be greater
than or equal to \fBbfd:min_rx\fR\fR.  The
implementation switches from \fBbfd:min_rx\fR to \fBbfd:decay_min_rx\fR when there is no obvious incoming
data traffic at the interface, to reduce the CPU and bandwidth cost
of monitoring an idle interface\fR.  This feature may be disabled by

Set to true to notify the remote endpoint that traffic should not be
forwarded to this system for some reason other than a connectivty

.IP "\fBbfd_params : check_tnl_key\fR: optional string, either \fBtrue\fR or \fBfalse\fR"

A distributed logical router is implemented by a set of VTEPs

to populate the local ARP cache for a logical router, it issues
ARP requests with a source MAC address that is unique to the VTEP\fR. A
single per-VTEP MAC can be re-used across all logical
networks\fR. This table contains the MACs that are used by the
VTEPs of a given HSC\fR. The table provides the mapping from MAC to
physical locator for each VTEP so that replies to the ARP
requests can be sent back to the correct VTEP using the
appropriate physical locator\fR.
